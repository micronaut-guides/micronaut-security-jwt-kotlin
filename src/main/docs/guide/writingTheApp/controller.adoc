<1> Annotate with `io.micronaut.security.Secured` to configure secured access. The `isAuthenticated()` expression will allow access only to authenticated users.
<2> Annotate with `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller` to designate a class as a Micronaut's controller.
<3> By default a Micronaut’s response uses `application/json` as Content-Type. We are returning a String not a JSON object. Because of that, we set it to `text/plain`.
<4> You can specify the HTTP verb that a controller's action responds to. To respond to a GET request, use the `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get` annotation.
<5> If a user is authenticated, Micronaut will bind the user object to an argument of type `java.security.Principal` (if present).
